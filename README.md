## Dependencies

### HTTP client

The Api Service component make use of the `Http\Client\HttpClient` interface 
provided by [HttPlug](http://httplug.io/) to send requests.

You can use your own HTTP client services within Symfony, 
but we strongly advice you to use the [HttplugBundle](https://github.com/php-http/HttplugBundle)

```bash
composer require php-http/httplug-bundle
```

You can then choose one the many HTTP client adapter supported by HTTPlug. A list 
is available [here](http://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/clients.html)

```bash
# for example, here we choose the Guzzle 6 adapter
composer require php-http/guzzle6-adapter
```

### Cache

This bundle have the ability to cache schema files used by you API services.  
It use the [PSR-6: Caching Interface](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-6/) to do so.

For performance reasons, the cache **SHOULD** be enable in production.

#### From Symfony 3.1 and above

Symfony 3.1 provide a cache implementation of the PSR-6 Caching Interface. You don't need
additional components to integrate caching capabilities to the framework.

#### From Symfony 2.7 to 3.1

We recommend you to use the [PSR-6 Cache adapter Bundle](https://github.com/php-cache/adapter-bundle).

You can then choose one of the many [cache pool implementations](http://www.php-cache.com/en/latest/#cache-pool-implementations) 
provided by the php-cache organization.
